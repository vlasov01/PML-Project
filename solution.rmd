Human Activity Recognition data files provided by http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
The training set has been pre processed by removing columns, which are not populated in the tesing set, so not relevant for the prediction.

As training dataset has significant number of rows I've select 500 samples for cross-validation and reduce bias.

I've used LDA method for prediction.

The accuracy of training set was very close to testing set results 14 correct predictions from 20, which is 70%. The training set prediction accuracy was:

  Accuracy   Kappa      Accuracy SD  Kappa SD  
  0.7019437  0.6226815  0.07177893   0.09075173
